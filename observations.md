# snapshot.org

## global config
a space is configured against a specified governance token.

## authenticity and validity
snapshot.org is entirely gasless meaning there is nothing committed onchain. to uphold a decentralized security model, elevated/administrative interactions are protected by a wallet message signature to guarantee trustworthiness across the platform.

### takeaway
this is a wise approach to alleviate offchain platform fud. its a 80/20 solve to provide a trusted while keeping a familiar user experience.

## voting
### nuances
- snapshot.org uses block heights/snapshots to establish a (fair?) voting power surface area for members. it appears they want to disallow hysteric whaling into the gov token after a proposal was created leading to outcome manipulation.
- total voting results consider cumulative relative holder voting power.
